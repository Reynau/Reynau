### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Xavi, a Full-Stack Developer passionate about design, tech, and fashion.

I started programming when I was 12 years old as a hobby. Since then, I've never stopped trying new technologies and playing around with different pet projects.

Now, after multiple years of personal and professional experience, I worked on projects related to procedural art generation, videogames, simulation, automation, societal challenges, web technologies, and more.
